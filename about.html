                <h2>About Western Genealogical Services</h2>
                <p><em>Western Genealogical Services</em> was established in 2015 by Wilton Albert Munson and Comgall Ó Brian as a response to a demand that they identified. There were several services out there but they were either amateurs who diid it as a hobby or they were large organisations that couldn’t possibly offer the personal touch. </p>
                <p>Wilton and Comgall shared a passion for research in general and genealogical research in particular and met while working on various family projects in the National Archives. They quickly realised that their expertise and aptitude could be put to use helping others find their ancestors and construct a family tree.</p>
                <p>Since 2015 <em>Western Genealogical Services</em> has grown and now employs a third full-time researcher, Vivienne Leclair. Our team also employs various archivists and professional genealogists on a contract basis so we are ready to expand our business to meet your needs. There is no such thing as leaving your request for months we guarantee a turnaround in less than one week or again we offer your money back. </p>
                <p> We are a member of all the professional organizations that govern historical research and fully acredited with <a href="http://accreditedgenealogists.ie">Accredited Geneoligists Ireland.<a/></p>
